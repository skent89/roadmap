# Packet Product Roadmap

Updated Mar 26, 2015

This document is intended to give a window into the priorities and upcoming
developments at Packet that will be released and come online next. It is not
intended to emphasize specific bug fixes and ongoing optimizations that we
undergo as part of our regular improvement and maintenance operations. We 
view this as a living document, and welcome edits, suggestions, and feedback!
